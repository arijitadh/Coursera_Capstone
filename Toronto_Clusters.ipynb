    "Introduction\n",
    "Coworking and flexi work space concepts have gained a lot of traction in recent years. These are arrangements in which workers from different companies share an office space, allowing cost savings and convenience through the use of common infrastructure, such as equipment and utilities and in some cases includes meals, refreshments and postal services. It is attractive to independent contractors, independent scientists, telecommuting and work-at-home professionals, and people who travel frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Description\n",
    "Coworking facilities have high maintenance costs and their profitability directly depends on the occupancy rates and overhead costs on account of rent, free services such as meals, refreshments, gyms etc. Further location is very important for success of these facilities. So, identification of appropriate location for setting up such facility is a key success factor.\n",
    "This project aims to aid the user with choosing an ideal location for such a facility in the Toronto area. It uses neighbourhood segmenting and clustering to group boroughs in the city and on this basis provides insights to 4 neighbourhood clusters to choose from based on 3 factors\n",
    "a.\tSurrounding facilities such as cafes, restaurants in the cluster (higher the better)\n",
    "b.\tAverage real estate rental (lower the better)\n",
    "c.\tNumber of postal codes (as surrogate to area/ size of cluster) in the cluster (higher the better)\n",
    "The first 2 factors will enable lower overhead costs, whereas the last factor will increase the catchment areas increase potential customers.\n"
